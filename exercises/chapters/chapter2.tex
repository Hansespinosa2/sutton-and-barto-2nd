\section{Multi-armed Bandits}

\subsection{Exercise 2.1}
define $a_1$, $a_2$ as the two actions that can be taken, $\varepsilon$ as the probability of selecting a random action, and $r$ as a randomly generated number $\in [0,1]$. 
\begin{equation}
    \text{action} = 
    \begin{cases}
        \text{random choice of $a_1$ or $a_2$} & \text{if } r < \varepsilon \\
        \text{greedy choice} & \text{if } r \geq \varepsilon
        \end{cases}
\end{equation}

if $\varepsilon$ is 0.5, there is a 0.5 probability of taking the greedy choice and 0.5 probability of picking the random choice. The random choice has two actions, therefore there is a choice of picking $a_1$ or $a_2$ with 0.25 prob each. $0.25 + 0.50 = 0.75$, therefore the probability of the greedy action getting selected is 0.75
